# Devloped an application to predict the price of a house based on the given input fields.

1.Collect dataset from kaggle contain features (area_type	availability	location	size	society	total_sqft	bath	balcony	price).

2.Conduct data preprocessing for handling missing values,detecting outliers and scaling the numerical features using StandardScale technique.

3.Identify the key features affecting the house price.

4.Use linear regression random forest decision tree algorithm for the model building.

5.Calculate the loss and accuracy of the model.

5.Apply hyperparameters tuning (GridSearchCV) for selecting the best model.

6.predict the output on new  data.
